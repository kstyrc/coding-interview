Knowledge areas:

1) Data structures & algorithms: Array, String, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph
  a) String: reverse, reverse word-wise, anagram, palindrom, string_to_int
  b) Linked List: remove/add, kth element from tail, middle element, detect cycle, reverse, reverse in groups
  c) Stack: stack with min/max/pop/push in O(1)
  d) Tree: traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder, breadth-first), predecessor/successor, find lowest common ancestor in BST, compare 2 trees, remove element from BST
  e) Graph: DFS, BFS, different representations, Dijkstra, games on boards, ...

2) Sorting and searching
